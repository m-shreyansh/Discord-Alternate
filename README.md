# Discord-Alternate
Discord-Alternate is an open source place where people can create their servers with friends or family and chat or talk with them. Further you can have multiple audio and chat channels for different contexts.

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git https://github.com/m-shreyansh/Discord-Alternate.git
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv myproject_env
$ source myproject_env/bin/activate
```

Then install Flask and flask_socketio

```sh
(env)$ pip install flask
(env)$ pip install flask_socketio
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment.

Once `pip` has finished downloading flask and flask_socketio:
```sh
(env)$ python app.py
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/home`.
