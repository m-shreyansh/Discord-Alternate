Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

$ source myproject_env/bin/activate
```

Then install Flask and flask_socketio

```sh
(env)$ pip install flask
(env)$ pip install flask_socketio
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment.
